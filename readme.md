Music Genre Classification using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project is an AI-based Music Genre Classification system that automatically predicts the genre of a music track using audio signal features. It helps in organizing music libraries, playlist generation, and recommendation systems.

Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of digital music platforms, manually classifying songs into genres is inefficient and inconsistent. An automated solution is required to accurately classify music using audio characteristics.

Solution

We developed a machine learning model that analyzes audio features such as MFCCs, tempo, and spectral characteristics to predict the genre of a given music clip.
